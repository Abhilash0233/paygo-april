The PayGo.fit logo should have the following characteristics:

1. A circle with gradient from #118347 to #0A5D31 (light to dark green)
2. The letters "PGO" in white inside the circle
3. The ".fit" part is in a lighter green color (#4CD964)
4. The logo should be simple, modern, and represent fitness/sports
5. The logo should look good in both light and dark backgrounds
6. It should be recognizable at small sizes (for app icons)

This placeholder text file serves as a reference for designers to create the actual logo.
For now, we're using the existing splash-icon.png in the app.
